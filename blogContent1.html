                “Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you are
                climbing it.”<small> -Andy Rooney</small>

                Life is a trek & despite of your willingness, you have to keep moving forward in life to conquer your
                destiny.

                Trekking is an <strong> outdoor activity</strong> of walking for more than a day. It is a form of
                walking, undertaken with the specific purpose of exploring and enjoying the scenery. Trekking could be a
                motive, It could be a commitment, an aim, an objective, a mission, a party, a social gathering. It could
                be a place where you find friends, and it could be a journey. It could be a slightest chance to save our
                future generation from losing the nature lovers, mother earth holding within. It can be shortened or
                extended as per the desire of trekkers.

                Trekking is more challenging than hiking since it tests one's ability, endurance and their mental as
                well as psychological capacity. There are many different ways to do a trek and trekking culture often
                varies from country to country. It usually takes place on trails in areas of relatively unspoiled
                wilderness.
