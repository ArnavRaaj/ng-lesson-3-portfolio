                Trekking is an <strong> outdoor activity</strong> of walking for more than a day. It is a form of
                walking, undertaken with the specific purpose of exploring and enjoying the scenery. Trekking could be a
                motive, It could be a commitment, an aim, an objective, a mission, a party, a social gathering. It could
                be a place where you find friends, and it could be a journey. It could be a slightest chance to save our
                future generation from losing the nature lovers, mother earth holding within. It can be shortened or
                extended as per the desire of trekkers.

                Trekking is more challenging than hiking since it tests one's ability, endurance and their mental as
                well as psychological capacity. There are many different ways to do a trek and trekking culture often
                varies from country to country. It usually takes place on trails in areas of relatively unspoiled
                wilderness.

                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 class="underline">Risks and preventions of the trek:</h2>
            <p>
                Although, trekking is exciting and thrilling it comes with great risk depending on your choice of the
                trek. The risk can be minimized or avoided if you follow the instruction you are provided with. Some of
                the dangers which you may encounter during the treks are:-
                <p>
                    Unexpected <strong>weather change, wildlife, bad footing, sunburn, not getting rescued</strong>, <a
                        href="" class="inline-links"> altitude sickness</a>,<a href="" class="inline-links">
                        dehydration</a>. To avoid these risk you should be prepared for the worst. Bring gear and
                    clothes to survive in bad weathers. Don't try to attract wildlife during your trek. They may be
                    charming but they can bring you some unwanted problems.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Mountains areas are always cold and in such weather, people don't feel thirsty but the amount of fluid
                needed for your body should be fulfilled. Mosquitos can be very dangerous during your trek because
                sometime you must stay in tents where you can be bitten by mosquitos. To prevent it you should simply
                apply mosquito repellent cream in all uncovered part of your skin.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most important thing you need to consider before continuing your trek is to give some information to
                the people you encounter during the trek like the staffs in a lodge. You should tell them when you will
                return back from there. There should be someone who knows that you are in trouble and needs to be
                rescued. When you are trekking to high altitude you should bring necessary medicines for altitude
                sickness.<strong>It doesn't matter how experienced trekker you are, there is always a possibility of
                    getting sick.</strong>
